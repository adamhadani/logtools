	Fixed bug in use of --ignore for logparse
	Default value for --delimiter is now ' ' across commands (logjoin etc.)
	
version 0.6

	Added Prefix/Suffix matching to filterbots - Specify p'<prefix>' or s'<suffix>' in useragents file to use this feature
	Added comment support for filterbots useragents/ips files - use '#' in start of line
	Added JSONParser to parsing module, can now use JSON-formatted logs e.g for logmerge, logparse etc.
	Added --ignore flag to logparse, surpresses missing field errors and skips those lines
	Added the 'timeseries' plot type for plotting timeseries data
	Added the matplotlib plotting backend supporting pie/line/timeseries charting
	Added data/examples subdirectory, included example bots_useragents.txt files	
	Can now specify fields by field name in -f parameter for the logparse method/console script
	Can now specify multiple comma-separated field names/indices in logparse method	
	Fixed memory bug resulting from un-needed use of readlines() on file descriptors
	Changed programmatic interface for most methods to use explicit parameter naming instead of generic (opts, args)
	Updated unit-tests, examples and README to reflect most of latest functionality
