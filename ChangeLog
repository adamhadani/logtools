	Tweaks to the 'percentiles' utility - Added optional -N argument to force
	tailing specific number of lines (samples), removed hard-coded 10000 lines
	limitation, changed sort to use -g (general numeral sort) and enforce
	LC_NUMERIC locale of en_US.utf-8 to correctly handle exponents (e.g '414e-05')

version 0.8.5

	Field names (for key-based -f lookup): 'ip', 'timestamp', 'method',
	'path', 'bytes', 'processing_time'.
	Added unit-test for the uWSGIParser
	Better exception handling for the logparse utility, now reports failure to match 
	used-specified --fields in more accurate manner, separate from failures in actual parsing of the logline.

	Updated unit-tests to reflect additions/changes to tools
	Unicode encoding in logplot line-plot using matplotlib backend (would crash with encoding problems in some cases)
	Unicode encoding for the logparse, fixes some cases of errors, e.g when using JSONParser for a JSON that has non-string types (e.g integers)
	Fixed bug in use of --ignore for logparse
	Default value for --delimiter is now ' ' across commands (logjoin etc.)
	
version 0.6
	Added --header flag to logparse, will prepend output with field names. useful e.g for dumping to CSV file
	Added --parser and --ip-ua-fields options to filterbots, allows routing input through a parser for filtering bots
	Updated logmerge to support indexed/named field-based merge-sorting when using --parser. See README for examples

	Added urlparse utility/API. See README for details
	Added logjoin utility/API. See README for details
	Added logtools.join_backends module with SQLAlchemy backend implementation (added sqlalchemy to install_requires)
	
version 0.5

	Added Prefix/Suffix matching to filterbots - Specify p'<prefix>' or s'<suffix>' in useragents file to use this feature
	Added comment support for filterbots useragents/ips files - use '#' in start of line
	Added JSONParser to parsing module, can now use JSON-formatted logs e.g for logmerge, logparse etc.
	Added --ignore flag to logparse, surpresses missing field errors and skips those lines
	Added the 'timeseries' plot type for plotting timeseries data
	Added the matplotlib plotting backend supporting pie/line/timeseries charting
	Added data/examples subdirectory, included example bots_useragents.txt files
