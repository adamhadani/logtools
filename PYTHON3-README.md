## Notes

These are short notes documenting the Python-3 port, which is still to
be considered experimental.

### Intent and issues found

The idea was to do a straightforward port to Python-3, since I wanted to
use the package with the native Python-3 on my Ubuntu 20.10 Linux.

Following issues were encountered:

- parts concerning `geoIP` have not been ported or tested, therefore are deemed
  not functional

- the `sqlsoup` package uses features of `SQLAlchemy`  ( `MapperExtension` ) which have 
  been deprecated (then suppressed since version 0.7; see
  https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/deprecated.html ).
  + Workable but abandonned (after `commit f63db028b5f14cd2aa` on May 5, 2021) story:
    + Current versions are `sqlsoup 0.9.1` and  `SQLAlchemy 1.4.0b3`. 
    + Make the port to require specific older
      versions. This suggests operate under `virtualenv`; ` setup.py` had been changed
	  accordingly. 
    + A file [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) has been added to document this, and
      can be used with `pip3`.
  + Current approach:
    + Removed all `SQLsoup` dependencies
	+ Used `SQLAlchemy` instead (`version >= 1.4.13`)
	+ Attempting to use the higher abstraction ORM, for query preparation and
	  possibly exploitation. 
  
- the package's usage of `datetime.strptime` in my locale `"fr_FR.UTF-8"`was found
  problematic ( `testQps` <I>fails when parsing date</I> `11/Oct/2000:14:01:14 -0700`
  <I>which is fine in my locale</I>) : 
  disabled statements `locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, "")`in 
  `_qps.py` and `_plot.py`. 
  The directory `aux` has been added with script `testStrptime.py` to test 
  under different locales. Multiple locales where tested in the CI (mostly
  Github's Actions framework)
  
- when experimenting the use of ̀logjoin` with `mysql`
  + installing the `PyMySQL` module proved tricky (On Linux/Ubuntu):
    1. pip3 install mysql-connector
	1. pip3 install PyMySQL
	1. needed to add the following in `__init__.py`:
	~~~
	import pymysql
    pymysql.install_as_MySQLdb()
	~~~
	
  + For connecting, the string form of the URL is 
     > dialect[+driver]://user:password@host/dbname[?key=value..], 
	 
     Example: `mysql://scott:tiger@hostname/dbname`
	 where 
	 + dialect is a database name such as mysql, oracle, postgresql, etc., and
	 + driver the name of a DBAPI, such as psycopg2, pyodbc, cx_oracle, etc. 
	 + Alternatively, the URL can be an instance of URL class.
     + this parameter may be set in ~/.logtoolsrc

  + this is required when using SQLAlchemy

  + Finally decided to use an up to date version of SQLAlchemy to handle 
     MySQL (8.xx). Updated version of PyMySQL: see above about package selection 


### Moving to sqlalchemy

1. Documentation for sqlalchemy: https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/index.html 
  + a more tutorial thing at 
    https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/engines.html#database-urls
	
1. Used SQLAlchemy as follows:
   + minor support of Core tools sufficient to run logjoin
   + more extensive support of ORM, in logjoin and logdb (added). 
   + ORM to be prioritized for future developments
   
   + only tested with mysql as database server.

## Added functionality

   See [PYTHON3-ADDITIONS](./PYTHON3-ADDITIONS.md). 
   In [FORMAT-CHEATSHEET](./FORMAT-CHEATSHEET.md), some help for parser format selection

## Test and operations
  
### Test and operative environment
 This is really setting up the development / maintenance environment; I developped
 the habit to use virtualenv with precisely versionned Python packages when 
 trying to operate with SQLSoup, since this entailed compatiblility issues. 
 It is probably not necessary now.
 
 - setup a `virtualenv`environment, requiring Python 3.8.6, ( or whatever version 
   you want to use.  Python 3.8.6 happens to be the native Python-3 on my system,
   with which all development and tests have been done: 
   ```
   cd <py3port-dir>
   virtualenv -p 3.8.6 .
   ``` 
 - populate it according to [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) 
 - development and maintenance of the package are all performed under this environment
 
### Installation
  
 This is a pure Python package. At the time of this writing, PRs have not been 
 accepted which would enable a straightforward installation via `Pypi`.
 
 The full functionality requires also a particular version of package `dpath-python`,
 adapted to accept regular expressions in both "bash/globbing" format at Python's `re`;
 otherwise it should degrade to accepting only "bash/globbing" format, but some
 of our tests will fail. *If this functionality becomes available, the process below
 will be simplified...*
 

 This process will install both; it  is  used in test
 https://github.com/AlainLich/logtools/blob/ALPython3/.github/workflows/pythonDBExercise.yml

 - setup <I>or activate</I> the `virtualenv` environment using the 
   [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) file.
   
 - copy or clone our versions of the packages:
   1. https://github.com/AlainLich/dpath-python (branch AL-addRegexp)
   2. https://github.com/AlainLich/logtools  (branch ̀ALPython3`)
 
   3. For each of these (in order)
      - change directory to the package (where `setup.py` and source code are found)
      - run `setup.py` using the python interpreter in the `virtualenv` environment:
 
      This is done as follows:
```
   # establish virtualenv
   . venvSandBox/bin/activate
   # keep track of wd and cd to source
   v=`pwd`

   pushd ${dpath_dir}
   $v/venvSandBox/bin/python3 setup.py install
   popd

   pushd ${logtools_dir}
   $v/venvSandBox/bin/python3 setup.py install
   popd
```

 
### Configuration 
   - establish a  `~/.logtoolsrc` file, which will used for setting 
     parameters or defaults. There are many fields needed from this configuration,
	 some of which can be overriden from the command line.
	 + for doing this, a model can be found in 
	  [aux/dot_logtoolsrc.sh](./aux/dot_logtoolsrc.sh) , which 
	   creates test configuration file(s) for CI in Github's Action system
	   
     + if using the database interface, login information will need to be 
	   provided in the files; this allows for keeping password secret.
	   
	 + if some files are named in the above configuration, they will need to
	   be provided too.
	   
   - For the following configuration files, named in   `~/.logtoolsrc`, 
     create and populate them,
     empty files are acceptable if there is no blacklist:
```
touch bots_hosts.txt         # File designated in ~/.logtoolsrc
touch bots_useragents.txt    # File designated in ~/.logtoolsrc
```

   - in the case of the .yml script example ,  file
   ` ~/.logtools.d/tradivariantParsing.txt `
     needs to be provided since it is named in  `~/.logtoolsrc`
	 (see example, where the files are generated for password
	 inclusion by script [aux/dot_logtoolsrc.sh](./aux/dot_logtoolsrc.sh) ).


### First experiments

 - `filterbots`: 
   1. extract log entries corresponding to some ̀sudo` uses. <I>Notice that 
   we are using the `-s` flag to define the level of output</I>
 ```
gunzip --stdout /var/log/auth.log.*.gz | \
cat /var/log/auth.log -  | \
filterbots -s ERROR -r ".*sudo:(?P<ua>[^:]+).*COMMAND=(?P<ip>\S+).*"  --print
 ```
 
  - filter :
  
  
  - `logmerge`
     1. Merges several logs sorting a field defined by delimiter (1 char) and field number:
          ```  
          logmerge -d'-' -f1 /var/log/auth.log /var/log/syslog | \
          grep -i upload
          ```
  
     2. Use a parser for merging 
	    -  the following supposes Apache Common Log Format
          see http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/logs.html#accesslog), examples shown in
		  [MORE-DOC.md](./MORE-DOC.md) :
          ```
           logmerge --parser CommonLogFormat -f4 /var/log/auth.log /var/log/syslog
           ```
        - by default `format='%h %l %u %t "%r" %>s %b'`

   - `logparse` 
      1. Parses according to parser format, select output field: 
	     <I>example extracts the date-time)</I>:
         ```
           cat testData/testCommonLogFmt.data | logparse --parser CommonLogFormat  -s INFO -f4
	     ```
		 
	  2. Same, selects multiple fields, <I> for some reason only 1 line is output</I>
	   
         ```
		 cat  testData/testCommonLogFmt.data| logparse --parser CommonLogFormat  -s DEBUG -f1,4
         ```
		 
      3. Added RFC 5424 parser `SyslogRFC5424`, here ̀-f`supports symbolic field selection 

         ```
         cat testData/testRFC5424.data | logparse --parser SyslogRFC5424 -f hostname -s INFO
         ```
		 
		 Field names can be found running with flag `-s DEBUG`

      4. Added a facility to handle logs specified by "traditional templates" in the style
         defined at url https://rsyslog-5-8-6-doc.neocities.org/rsyslog_conf_templates.html.
		 Usable with /var/log/{syslog,kern.log,auth.log}.
		 ```
		 cat testData/TestAuth.data  | \
		     logparse --parser TraditionalFileFormat -f TIMESTAMP -s ERROR	
		 ```
         Among capabilities, handle Docker log format:
		 
		 ```
		 docker container logs mysql1  2>/dev/stdout >/dev/null| head -2| \
		 logparse  --parser   DockerCLog --raw \
		               -f TIMESTAMP,NUM,bracket,bracket1,bracket2,msg  -s ERROR
		 ```
		 where DockerCLog is defined in parsers2.py, but could also be supplied
		 via configuration file in section `RSysTradiVariant`, outputs
					   
		 ```
	     2021-04-26T...Z	0	[System]	[MY-010116]	[Server]	.../mysqld () starting ...
         2021-04-26T...Z	1	[System]	[MY-013576]	[InnoDB]	InnoDB initialization start	
		 ```
		
	  5. Added `logdb`, performing more database operations from logs:				   

         As an example, exploiting docker's inspect output 

         ~~~
         docker image inspect nginx | \
	     wrapList2Json.py | \
	     logparse --parser JSONParserPlus -f "TOP" | head -1 | \
	     logdb -f "TOP/*/{RepoTags|Config}/{Env}" --frontend JSONParserPlus \
    	                 --join-remote-key "application" \
			             --join-remote-name EventTable 
         ~~~ 
   
		 Enters the following in the database, which is reminiscent of "Triple Store" for
		 RDF, and borrows ideas from `SQLAlchemy/example/code/adjacencyList.py`
		 
         ~~~

         **Note**: utility `wrapList2Json.py`is  in directory 
		 `./aux/testData/ActionsMysqlTest/scripts/wrapList2Json.py`, it will probably
		 move to appear with other executables in later versions. It's function is 
		 to wrap a JSONish list into a directory entry with key `TOP`.
