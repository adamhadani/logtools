# The pymysql module dependency is not included in the logtools requirements

PyMySQL>=1.0.2
#
# 'cryptography' package is required for sha256_password or caching_sha2_password auth
#  methods.
#  Note This does not seem to be a requirement for SQLAlchemy, see 'pip show';
#       may be the requirement depends on connection type, parameters or
#       negotiation with server. For now I do not put this in logtools requirements,
#       to avoid increasing the footprint.
