#  Required for running tests in No Database configuration
#
#  We expressely do not include pymysql, since the purpose of the test
#  is to check that when we do not use DB, the footprint is not encumbered with
#  it!
#
# 'cryptography' package is required for sha256_password or caching_sha2_password auth
#  methods.
#  Note This does not seem to be a requirement for SQLAlchemy, see 'pip show';
#       may be the requirement depends on connection type, parameters or
#       negotiation with server. For now I do not put this in logtools requirements,
#       to avoid increasing the footprint.
#cryptography>=3.0

# Try without, pip does not seem to complain when the requirements file is
# empty
